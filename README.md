## Building locally

To build the extension locally, run `npm install && npm run build`. This will generate an exploded version of the extension in the `dist/` folder.

Use [`web-ext run`](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext) from the `dist/` folder to run it locally in Firefox, or `web-ext build` to create a package.
